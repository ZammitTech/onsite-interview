### Given an input file with `four billion` unsorted integers, each integer is `32-bits`

### provide an algorithm to generate an integer (`32-bits`) which is not contained in the file.

Maximum time complexity allowed `O(2n)` _(Hint: no sorting allowed)_

_Easy:_ No memory limit

_Medium_: 1 GB limit

_Hard:_ 1 MB limit
